It turns out nice tools aren't cheap and this has left me almost no money for lumber. So I decided to take on a pallet wood project to keep learning in the meantime.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/pallet_coffee_table/DSC_0012.jpg" alt="1"></p>
<p>I'm pretty happy with how it turned out and it's given me a lot of ideas to work with in the future. I believe the top is a mix of red and white oak and the legs are some variety of spalted maple.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/pallet_coffee_table/DSC_0018.jpg" alt="1"></p>
<p>When I started this project I had no plans of starting a blog so the build photo's are going to be a little sub par on this one. They should at least give you an idea how this went together.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/pallet_coffee_table/IMG_20151025_175830.jpg" alt="1"></p>
<p>Here's the pallet I started with all broken down. Everything came from a single large pallet that was essentially three eight foot long red oak two by fours covered in a mix of white oak and maple slats.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/pallet_coffee_table/IMG_20151028_081440.jpg" alt="1"></p>
<p>After surfacing one face of each, I laminated the white oak slats to build them up to the thickness of the red oak two by fours.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/pallet_coffee_table/IMG_20151101_203753.jpg" alt="1"></p>
<p>After laminating all of them I surfaced and jointed them and glued them up into a table top. I used the solid red oak on all outside edges to hide the lamination joints.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/pallet_coffee_table/IMG_20151107_112041.jpg" alt="1"></p>
<p>I used a router to cut the mortises for the breadboard ends. It couldn't plunge quite deep enough so I finished the deeper sections with a drill press and chisels.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/pallet_coffee_table/IMG_20151108_103118.jpg" alt="1"></p>
<p>And here's the breadboard tenon from one side. I used a router to get then tenon to thickness and then used a coping saw and chisels to form the shape.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/pallet_coffee_table/IMG_20151115_164355.jpg" alt="1"></p>
<p>Here you can see the leg blanks. I laminated the maple slats for these. I used a simple table saw taper jig for the leg brace angles. They were then cleaned up and matched with a #4 bench plane.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/pallet_coffee_table/IMG_20151118_203847.jpg" alt="1"></p>
<p>The leg mortises were made using a drill press to hog the waste and chisels to clean up the final shape.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/pallet_coffee_table/IMG_20151121_140402.jpg" alt="1"></p>
<p>This is what you do when you don't have a vise.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/pallet_coffee_table/IMG_20151122_144314.jpg" alt="1"></p>
<p>Here are the pieces coming together. You can see the breadboards have been attached.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/pallet_coffee_table/IMG_20151205_132421.jpg" alt="1"></p>
<p>Here the legs are being setup for tapering. This taper jig consists of a piece of plywood with a single runner and two toggle clamps screwed to blocks that I just screw to whatever spot I need them in. It's really simple but has been a workhorse for tapering and edge jointing.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/pallet_coffee_table/IMG_20151206_203350.jpg" alt="1"></p>
<p>There was so much void filling in this project. I used harbor freight epoxy and a tiny amount of black acrylic paint to tint it. It worked great but was a bit of a pain. Definitely use masking tape if you ever do this. It greatly reduces how much epoxy you have to scrape off later.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/pallet_coffee_table/IMG_20151218_182232.jpg" alt="1"></p>
<p>I cut the corners of the table top at a forty-five with a back saw and then used a plane to round them.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/pallet_coffee_table/IMG_20160110_203110.jpg" alt="1"></p>
<p>The legs and leg braces got rounded over with a router.</p>
